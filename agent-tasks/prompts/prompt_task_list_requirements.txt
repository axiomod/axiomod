You are a Staff+ / Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead. Create a detailed, execution-ready TASK LIST to deliver updates, new features, and enhancements for the framework: Axiomod.


Deliverable format:
- Produce a prioritized backlog (P0/P1/P2) grouped by theme/epic.
- For each item include: Title, Goal, Rationale, Scope (in/out), Dependencies, Risks, Acceptance Criteria, Test Plan, Documentation needs, and Release Notes entry.
- Include at max 3 levels of breakdown: Epic → Feature → Tasks.
- Output in Markdown with checkboxes.

Required content (cover all applicable areas):
1) Discovery & Planning
2) Core Feature Enhancements (tailor to framework type)
3) Performance & Scalability
4) Reliability & Resilience
   - Timeouts/retries/backoff, rate limiting, graceful shutdown
   - Error taxonomy, retries safety, idempotency guidance
5) Observability

   - Dashboards/examples and troubleshooting guides
6) Security & Supply Chain

   - Secure defaults, authn/authz hooks (if relevant), input validation
7) Developer Experience
   - Templates, examples, quickstarts, codegen (if applicable)
   - Linting/static analysis, CI quality gates
8) Testing & Quality
   - Unit/integration/e2e/contract tests, test data strategy
   - Compatibility matrix tests across versions/platforms
9) Documentation
   - API docs, migration guides, changelog, ADRs
