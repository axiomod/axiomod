You are a Senior Software Architect and Go platform expert (10+ years). Produce a formal, critical, evidence-driven “Enterprise Framework Assessment Report” for adopting the Golang framework: [FRAMEWORK_NAME] for an enterprise application.

Context (fill what you know; state assumptions for blanks):
- Domain/Organization: [DOMAIN]
- App type: [multi-tenant SaaS / B2B API / internal platform / payments / etc.]
- Architecture: [microservices / modular monolith / event-driven], comms: [REST/gRPC/GraphQL]
- Scale/SLAs: [RPS, peak users, regions, latency/uptime targets]
- Deployment: [Kubernetes/ECS/bare metal], Cloud: [AWS/Azure/GCP], IaC: [Terraform/etc]
- Compliance: [SOC2/HIPAA/PCI/GDPR/ISO27001]
- Current stack & integrations: [DB, messaging, cache, gateway, identity, observability]
- Team maturity: [# engineers, Go experience, DevOps maturity]

Write the report with the following sections (use headings + bullets; keep marketing tone out):
1) Executive Summary
   - Recommendation: Adopt / Adopt with Conditions / Do Not Adopt
   - 3–5 decision drivers and the key tradeoffs
2) Framework Overview & Maturity
   - What it is, ecosystem/community maturity, release cadence signals, upgrade risk
   - Fit with idiomatic Go (simplicity, explicitness, composition over magic)
3) Architecture & Extensibility Fit
   - Routing/middleware, validation, error handling, authn/authz patterns
   - DI approach (or lack thereof), modularity/layering, plugin/extensibility model
   - gRPC compatibility, schema/contract support, versioning strategy
4) Operational Readiness (prod/Kubernetes)
   - Graceful shutdown, health/readiness, config/secrets, feature flags, config reload
   - Resilience patterns (timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, rate limiting)
   - Background jobs/scheduling and queue integration approach
5) Observability & Diagnostics (implementation-level detail)
   - Structured logging, metrics, tracing, context propagation
   - OpenTelemetry compatibility, trace/span conventions, correlation IDs
   - Profiling and debugging plan (pprof, memory/CPU, contention)
6) Security & Supply Chain
   - Secure defaults, OWASP risks (input validation, SSRF, authz, deserialization, etc.)
   - OAuth2/OIDC/JWT, mTLS, RBAC/ABAC support patterns
   - Dependency risk, SBOM, vulnerability scanning, SLSA-style considerations
7) Performance, Scalability & Reliability
   - Likely bottlenecks, concurrency behavior, memory implications
   - Horizontal scaling, multi-region, failure modes, backpressure
8) Maintainability & Developer Experience
   - Project structure conventions, codegen usage, testing story (unit/integration/contract/e2e)
   - Tooling guardrails (linting, static analysis), onboarding, “golden paths”
9) Compatibility & Integration
   - DB access patterns/ORM stance, migrations, caching, messaging (Kafka/Rabbit/SQS), service discovery
10) Risks, Gaps, and Mitigations
   - Provide a risk register with severity/impact/mitigation/owner
11) Adoption Playbook
   - 2–4 week PoC plan with acceptance criteria + go/no-go gates
   - Reference architecture narrative + templates/standards to institutionalize
   - Migration approach (greenfield/strangler/hybrid) with rollout steps
12) Final Recommendation & Next Steps

Hard requirements:
- Include TWO tables:
  A) Evaluation Matrix with weighted criteria (0–5 scoring) and a final weighted score.
  B) Risk Register (severity, probability, impact, mitigation, owner, timeframe).
- Include “Assumptions” and “Open Questions”.
- Include an Appendix with:
  - Sample folder structure for a production service
  - Service template outline/pseudocode (no full code)

Output should read like an internal architecture review board document: concise, structured, and actionable.
