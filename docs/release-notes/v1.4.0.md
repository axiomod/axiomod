# v1.4.0 - Enterprise Readiness & Deep Observability 🛡️

This release focuses on hardening the framework for enterprise deployments with deep health monitoring, dynamic configuration capabilities, a fully tested plugin ecosystem, and robust CI/CD infrastructure.

## 🌟 Key Highlights

### 👁️ Deep Observability (Epic P2.4)

- **Deep Health Checks**: Beyond simple liveness, the framework now checks database and Kafka connectivity in the `/ready` endpoint.
- **Custom Health Registration**: The `health` package now allows registering custom check functions.
- **Plugin Health Integration**: Plugins can now register their own health checks during initialization, providing a truly modular observability picture.

### ⚙️ Dynamic Configuration (Epic P2.4)

- **Hot Reloading**: Implemented `fsnotify` based file watching. The application now detects configuration file changes at runtime.
- **WatchConfig API**: New `WatchConfig` method in the `config.Provider` interface allows components to subscribe to configuration updates.

### 🧩 Plugin Ecosystem (Epic P2.2)

- **Full Verification**: Comprehensive unit tests added for all core plugin stubs (LDAP, SAML, Multi-Tenancy, Audit, ELK).
- **Lifecycle Improvements**: Refined start/stop logic and error handling across all plugins.

### 🏗️ Infrastructure & Quality (Epic P2.6 & P2.3)

- **Dependency Audit**: Full audit of `go.mod` with cleanup and documentation of key dependencies in [Dependencies](./dependencies.md).
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) added for automated formatting, vetting, testing (with race detection), and building.

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Plugin Interface**: The `Plugin.Initialize` method signature has changed to accept `*health.Health`. All custom plugins must be updated.
- **Plugin Registry**: `NewPluginRegistry` constructor now requires `*health.Health` to be passed.
