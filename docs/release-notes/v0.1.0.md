# v1.0.0 - Enterprise Ready 🚀

We are proud to announce the first stable release of **Axiomod**, the enterprise-grade Go macroservice framework. This release marks a major milestone, delivering a hardened, fully documented, and production-ready foundation for building scalable microservices.

## 🌟 Key Highlights

* **Clean Architecture Enforcement**: Strict separation of concerns (Domain, Usecase, Delivery, Infrastructure) powered by `uber-go/fx` dependency injection.
* **Production-Grade Plugins**:
  * **Database**: Native support for MySQL and PostgreSQL with connection pooling and transaction management.
  * **Authentication**: Built-in JWT validation and OIDC integration (Keycloak ready).
  * **Observability**: Out-of-the-box structured logging (Zap), Prometheus metrics, and OpenTelemetry tracing.
* **Resilience & Async**: Integrated Background Worker pool and Kafka Producer/Consumer implementation.
* **Developer Experience**:
  * `axiomod` CLI for rapid project scaffolding (`init`, `generate`).
  * Comprehensive documentation suite.
