# v0.2.0 - Claude Code Integration 🤖

We are excited to announce **v0.2.0** of the Axiomod framework. This release introduces a comprehensive Claude Code configuration for all contributors, embedding project-specific AI assistance directly into the repository. No source code changes are included in this release -- all changes are developer tooling and documentation.

## 🌟 Key Highlights

* **AI-Assisted Development**: A full `.claude/` configuration directory now ships with the framework, giving every contributor consistent, context-aware AI assistance tuned to Axiomod's architecture and conventions.
* **15 Coding Rules**: Detailed, auto-loaded rule files cover every layer and subsystem -- from naming conventions and error handling to database patterns and CI/build workflows.
* **10 Specialized Agents**: Purpose-built agents for architecture review, Go implementation, plugin creation, domain scaffolding, API design, performance profiling, unit testing, security scanning, requirements verification, and documentation updates.
* **5 Reusable Skills**: Slash-command workflows for validating architecture, generating domain modules, creating plugins, preparing releases, and adding endpoints.
* **Contributor Guide**: A new `docs/claude-code-guide.md` documents every aspect of the `.claude/` directory -- how to use it, extend it, and keep the token budget manageable.

## 📦 What's New

### `.claude/` Directory

The entire Claude Code configuration is now committed to the repository, making it available to all contributors automatically.

#### `CLAUDE.md` -- Project Instructions

The primary instruction file loaded at the start of every Claude Code session. Covers quick commands, layer structure, import rules, fx module patterns, plugin system, config system, error handling, domain module structure, observability wrappers, testing conventions, and the post-implementation checklist.

#### Rules (`.claude/rules/`)

15 numbered rule files provide detailed, enforceable guidelines with code examples:

| File | Topic |
|------|-------|
| `01-coding-style.md` | Naming, formatting, imports, constructor patterns |
| `02-architecture.md` | Layer boundaries, import direction, forbidden cross-domain imports |
| `03-error-handling.md` | `framework/errors` constructors, error codes, HTTP/gRPC mapping |
| `04-testing.md` | Table-driven tests, `testify`, manual mocks, fx integration tests |
| `05-fx-dependency-injection.md` | `var Module = fx.Options(...)`, lifecycle hooks, module wiring |
| `06-http-delivery.md` | Fiber handler struct, `RegisterRoutes`, route groups |
| `07-grpc-delivery.md` | gRPC service struct, method pattern, interceptor chain |
| `08-plugin-system.md` | 4-method Plugin interface, lifecycle, built-in plugins |
| `09-domain-patterns.md` | Entity, repository, use case, domain service, memory repo patterns |
| `10-middleware.md` | Struct-with-`Handle()` pattern, available middleware, application order |
| `11-config-system.md` | `Config` struct hierarchy, YAML keys, `APP_` env prefix |
| `12-observability.md` | Logger, tracer, metrics wrappers, health check registration |
| `13-resilience.md` | Circuit breaker, retry, timeout, fallback patterns |
| `14-database.md` | Connection, transactions, query wrappers, migration commands |
| `15-ci-build.md` | Make targets, ldflags, GitHub Actions pipeline, pre-submit checklist |

#### Agents (`.claude/agents/`)

10 specialized agents with distinct responsibilities and tool restrictions:

* **arch-guard** -- Read-only architecture validator; runs `axiomod validator architecture` and reports import violations.
* **axiomod-go** -- Framework-aware Go developer; implements features end-to-end with proper fx wiring, error handling, and tests.
* **plugin-builder** -- Creates plugins implementing the 4-method Plugin interface, registers them, and adds config entries.
* **domain-scaffolder** -- Generates Clean Architecture domain modules with the standard 8-package structure.
* **api-designer** -- Designs dual-protocol (HTTP + gRPC) APIs ensuring consistency across both transports.
* **perf-profiler** -- Read-only performance analyst; runs benchmarks, `pprof`, and trace analysis.
* **unit-tester** -- Writes table-driven unit tests using `testify`, manual mocks, and fx integration test patterns.
* **security-scanner** -- Read-only vulnerability scanner across 10 OWASP categories; reports findings with severity levels.
* **requirements-verifier** -- Post-implementation quality gate; runs the full verification checklist and produces a pass/fail report.
* **docs-updater** -- Updates `docs/` to reflect code changes; never modifies source code.

#### Skills (`.claude/skills/`)

5 multi-step workflow skills invoked via slash commands:

* **validate-arch** -- Runs architecture validation and suggests refactoring for any violations found.
* **gen-module** -- Scaffolds a new domain module and lists post-generation wiring tasks.
* **new-plugin** -- Creates a plugin file, tests, registration, and config entry end-to-end.
* **release** -- Pre-release checks, version bump, commit, tag, and optional GitHub release creation.
* **add-endpoint** -- Adds a use case, handler method, gRPC method, and tests for a new endpoint in an existing module.

#### `settings.json` -- Tool Permissions

Committed tool permission controls that apply to all contributors:

* **Allowed**: Build tools (`make`, `go test`, `go build`), all `axiomod` CLI subcommands, `docker build`, read-only git operations (`git status`, `git log`, `git diff`), GitHub CLI (`gh pr`, `gh issue`).
* **Denied**: Sensitive file reads/edits (`.env`, `service_local.yaml`, `*.pem`, `*.key`), destructive commands (`rm -rf`, `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`).

### Documentation

* **[Claude Code Guide](../claude-code-guide.md)**: Comprehensive guide covering all 32 `.claude/` files -- directory structure, CLAUDE.md contents, rule reference table, agent reference, skill reference, settings, local settings, auto-memory, token budget breakdown, and how to extend each component.
* **Updated `docs/README.md`**: Added a Contributing & Tooling section linking to the Claude Code Guide.
* **Updated `.gitignore`**: Excludes `settings.local.json` (personal Claude Code settings) from version control.
